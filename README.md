# graphics-waterfall


This was my senior project where we got an inspiration from the Osaka City Station waterfall, which water droplets are
displayed in visual forms. The prototype is in a size of 32X8 pixels. Using 32 solenoid valves and the design is constructed to be 3 meters high. 


Once compiled the interface should look like below.
